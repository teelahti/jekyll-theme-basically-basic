A while ago [I blogged about a recurring problem in my laptop: event log was filling with Software protection service scheduling errors](/blog/windows-8-fix-failed-to-schedule-software-protection-service-for-re-start---0x80070005), 
and the fix was to change one system folder's permissions. I ended up re-installing my 
laptop from scratch (to Windows 8.1), and again after I joined the machine to our company 
domain and installed Symantec Endpoint Protection the problem re-appeared. I still do not 
know which - domain or SEP or both together - is the root cause, but as the problem emerged 
over and over again, I gave up and automatized the change. I created one batch file: 

```bat
ECHO OFF
ECHO Fixing Software protection service scheduling ACL problem.
icacls %systemroot%\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\SoftwareProtectionPlatform /grant "NETWORK SERVICE":(OI)(CI)F
```

...and scheduled this file with admin permissions to run semi-frequently (one could 
also add an event log trigger to this one event). Problem solved (for now).
