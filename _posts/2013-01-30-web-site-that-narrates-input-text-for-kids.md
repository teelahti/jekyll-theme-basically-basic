Last year, when my kids got interested in learning to read and write, I decided to do what I tend to do: bring technology to the table. I created a simple web site that narrates input text, and shows navigable history of the given input on the page.

I created this on Finnish only, but changing the language is relatively easy 
(i.e. only a couple minutes work). If you wish to use this, I just put the 
[]source code on GitHub](https://github.com/teelahti/ReadAloudWeb). If 
you wish to play with the Finnish version, I host it at 
[http://lue.teelahti.fi](http://lue.teelahti.fi). For my kids 
I put this full screen, and it kept them occupied for as long as half an 
hour (= eternity for kids).
