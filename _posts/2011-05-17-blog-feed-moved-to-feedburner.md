I intended to use [Feedburner](http://feedburner.google.com/) from the beginning, but I did not find an easy way to 
modify [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/) (the CMS behind this blog) to link to an external feed. Luckily 
[Bertrand Le Roy](http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/) came to rescue and created [Vandelay Feedburner plugin](http://orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Vandelay.Feedburner/1.0), which works great.

From now on this blogâ€™s feed is hosted at [feeds.feedburner.com/Tero-Teelahti](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Tero-Teelahti); 
old address still works but if you follow this blog please change to the new location since that will be more reliable in the long run.
