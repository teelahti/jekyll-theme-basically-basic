New Internet Explorers have a necessary (?) but annoying feature called "Compatibility view".
I do not need that in my sites since I try to keep my HTML in good shape. Therefore on
all projects I want to disable the feature since usually it breaks the layout. Disabling
compatibility view can be done by adding a meta tag to HTML head:

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
```

â€¦or, as it turns out,
[by adding a custom HTTP header with the same content](<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325(v=vs.85).aspx>).
This HTTP-header-way is much better for me as I can include it in my
[default web.config changes](http://teelahti.fi/blog/iis-7.x-cache-optimizations) I
use on almost every web project.

```xml
<system.webserver>
  <httpProtocol>
    <customHeaders>
      <!-- No need to expose the platform -->
      <remove
        name="X-Powered-By" />
      <!-- Do not show IE compatibility view -->
      <remove
        name="X-UA-Compatible"/>
      <add
        name="X-UA-Compatible"
        value="IE=edge"/>
    </customHeaders>
  </httpProtocol>
```

### Update 4.2.2014

Check my [newer post](/yet-another-take-on-internet-explorer-compatibility-mode/) for better solution that covers more IE versions.
